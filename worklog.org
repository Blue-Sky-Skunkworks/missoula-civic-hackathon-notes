  The Judgement

      Holding Together brings good fortune.
      Inquire of the oracle once again
      Whether you possess sublimity, constancy, and perseverance;
      Then there is no blame.
      Those who are uncertain gradually join.
      Whoever comes too late
      Meets with misfortune.

  The Image

      On the earth is water:
      The image of Holding Together.
      Thus the kings of antiquity
      Bestowed the different states as fiefs
      And cultivated friendly relations
      With the feudal lords.
